<TH><h3>A JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME</h3>

<left><p>In regards to the achievements of The Queen of Sheba, it is her journey from her mysterious land to visit the famed king of Israel Solomon, son of King David, the most famous king in the Hebrew Christian Bible. This journey stands alone in history and is the number one accomplishement that she is remembered for. This journey, featured in just a few verses in both the Qur'an and Hebrew Christian scriptures, makes her one of the most lengedary Queens in world history. Therefore, her main achievement is her legacy, which is unequalled in history, before or since her visit to King Solomon. However, this legacy is remembered specifically because of the details that have been left and recorded in these Holy books that state that she was very wealthy and that her tribute to King Solomon, was more valuable than any tribute Israel ever received. Also, she is the only foriegner in Ancient history who is said to have accepted and converted to the Hebrew God and religion, which she brought back to her people. However, outside of these Holy references of this legendary visit, a greater more measurable achievement exist that is seldom spoken of, or even known. This achievement is her lineage that she is a central figure within, a lineage that is possibly one of the longest recorded family tree's within the world  that through her story, brings together the most Ancient and most modern history.

<li>XXI. Soliman Tehagi 3244</li>
</TH>

<TH>Here are some people mentioned in the line of The Queen of Sheba that lived long before she was born and they are also very important figures in the history of the monarchy of Ethiopia and possibly the world, however few people know of these Ethiopian monarchs and there possible significance. Let us see. The Ethiopian royal dynasty given by Haile Selassie I started over 6,000 years ago, making it the oldest family tree on Earth. This dynasty began with a king called Ori. To most, this first king of Ethiopia may not be recognised in history, however all ancients records prove that the first king of Ethiopia was also king of what is now known as Egypt. This is testified not only by the ancient Ethiopians and the ancient Egyptians themselves, but by all ancient historians who speak of the origins of these to great empires. Interestingly, however is that all references both ancient and modern agree that this king was named either Osiris, or/and his son Horus both names very similar to Ori and could be according to this list none other. It is also believed that King Ori who is also called Aram may also be Shem in the Bible the son of Noah, but no evidence of this exist. Also, in this early lineage of Ethiopian monarchs we find Queen Borsa, although we have no history of this queen, she was the 3rd monarch to rule over Ethiopia, which also shows from the beginning females were treated equal to men, making Queen Borsa possibly the oldest Queen in history anywhere in the world. In this early lineage, we also have mentioned Nimroud who was the 12th king of Ethiopia who ruled in 3776, for 60 years. This Nimroud is none other than the Nimrod mentioned in the Bible at Genesis 10:13 who alledgely built the Tower of Babel. However, as this list indicates Nimrod or Nimroud lived at least 1,000 years before this supposed tower was built. Not even the bible states that Nimrod had anything to do with the building of the tower, this is tradition not from the Bible, so this list is the only confirmation outside of the Bible that Nimrod did not build the Tower of Babel. The 22nd king Soliman Tehagi, is the first recorded name Solomon in history in any nation, at least 2,500 years before King Solomon of Israel was born.</TH>

Emperor Menelik II
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ethiopiancrown.org/">HERE IS A LINK TO THE ETHIOPIAN MONARCHY TODAY THE CROWN COUNCIL IN EXILE</a>
<br>
</TH>

<TH>The Queen of Sheba also known as The Queen of The South, The Queen of Saba, Bilqis, but affectionally as Queen Makedah to her Ethiopian subjects has a very rich and long history in Ethiopian tradition. Many Kings and Queens who have featured in the history of other nations were also Ethiopians and can be found also in the list of this Queen's Ancestors and Descendants. As this list of monarchs span for approximately 6,000 years with 336 monarchs some ruling for as little a 2 days and others for over 50 years makes this a very comprehensive and useful tool for us to study about not only Ethiopian history, but the history of the world and even in our modern times. As this website has been created as introduction to the history and heritage of this lengedary Queen and to help people better understand her importance as significance, as well as her legacy today in our modern world, I will highlight just a few important figures that have shaped not only Ethiopian but world history. To the left is a list of these historical figures, please click the link to find out more about them. Here I will just give you a little introduction to each one to help you get started.

<h3>LENGEDARY KINGS AND QUEENS BEFORE CHRIST</h3>

The 1st figure of interest I would like to note is Kam the 22nd, ruler of Ethiopia and founder of the 2nd Dynasty. This figure can be associated directly with Egypt as Kam is the original name the Egyptians gave to themselves in the form of Kamites a tribal name indicating that they may have descended from this Kam as he is the first Kam mentioned in history. This is the same for our 2nd figure Saba II the 31st ruler, who ruled about 2345 BC who represents the first mentioned of Saba in the world and coincides with the founding of the Kingdom of Saba of Yemen. Likewise, the 51st ruler of Ethiopia, Etiyopus I a name very similar to name Ethiopia, who is called the 1st monarch to be given this name coincides with the figure or personality, mentioned in Odyssey and the Iliad the oldest Greek poem and literature written by Homer. Who tells us about the king of Ethiopia (aka Memnon) who came to the aid of the King of Troy in around 1700-1900 BC, who Homer told us when he wrote in 8th Century BC that the Ethiopians were possible named after. Next, we have The Queen of Sheba, Makedah herself and her son Menelik I said to be fathered by King Solomon of Israel. From this time forward, Kings and Queens of Ethiopia, now called Solomonic, due to this union, have had very close ties with Israel and the Hebrew people. Also of importance is Kashta Hanyon who ruled in 752 the 109th ruler of Ethiopia who is well-known in history as he was also the Pharoah of Egypt and founded thier 25th dynasty in 740 BC. Sabaka II left us a stone known as the Sabaka Stone that confirms that the first King of Ethiopia was also the first King of Egypt who as Horus.

<h3>LENGEDARY KINGS AND QUEENS AFTER CHRIST</h3>

Now there are 225 Kings and Queens from Makedah to Haile Selassie I, many of these monarchs are well-known figures in history. Here I will make a mention of just a few of them. Notable in this lineage of monarchs after Christ is Garsemot Kandake VI, who ruled in 50 AD and was the 166th monarch from Ori. This is the legendary Queen mentioned in the Bible as Queen Candace who had sent her treasure to Israel, who on his return was met by Phillip the Disciple and Baptised. This treasurer is known in the Bible only as Ethiopian Eunach, but Ethiopians know him as Jen Daraba. Next we have King Abreha Atsbeha, also known in history as King Ezana, who ruled from 332-360 AD, who is a credited to have become only a second King in history to have converted his country to Christianity, which today it stills remains, making it the oldest unconqured continous Christian country on Earth. This Christianity and his heritage was further endorsed by Emperor Lalibala in 1173, the 263rd ruler responsible for constructing the rock cut Churches in Lalibela Auxm a modern archaelogical mystery. This rich and glorious heritage of the Ethiopian Monarchs from before and after Queen Makedah was threatned by extinction many times in its 6,000 years of history, the most recent of which was attempts by Italy in modern times in 1887-1889 in the first Ethiopian-Italian war, when Emperor Menelik II defeated the Italian forces retaining his soverignity, the only African nation to do so. And again in 1935-1940, Italy tried again under the facist dictator Mussolini that was defeated by HIM Haile Selassie I that was supported by the British in 1941. Haile Selassie I ruled from 1930-1974, he was the 336th ruler of Ethiopia from King Ori and the last monarch to be seated on the throne due to a cou in 1974. 

<br>
<h3>THE MONARCHY TODAY</h3>
Today, the descendants of Haile Selassie I and therefore The Queen of Sheba, Makedah are in exile and scattered around the world, awaiting their return to the Ethiopian throne and reestablishment of the Solomonic Dynasty that began with Queen Makedah.

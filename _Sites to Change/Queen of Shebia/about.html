<TH>Although The Queen of Sheba is a well known figure in the Bible and Bible tradition, very little is known about her. She is mentioned only a few times within the book, namely at 1 Kings 10:10, when she appears for the first time, as a visitor of King Solomon. King Solomon is one of the most famous Kings in Hebrew and World History. It is possibly because of Solomon's fame why the visit of this mysterious queen has remained so important in the Bible tradition. This story of the Queen's visit is also repeated in the Bible book of 2nd Chronicles Verse 9:1-13, where the gifts  brought by this Queen was also highlighted as in much abundance, never seen before in Hebrew History, indicating the wealth of this Queen. In both 1st Kings and 2nd Chronicles 9, the purpose of The Queen of Sheba's visit to King Solomon was to hear his great wisdom, which she learned and took back to her homeland. She was also, as the Bible states given by Solomon all that this Queen asked and desired of him and so she returned home to the Land of Sheba with great joy. The only other references of importance to The Queen of Sheba in Bible comes from the New Testament, in the book of Matthew, Chapter 12:44 and Luke Chapter 11 Verse 13, where Jesus himself refers to this visit of The Queen of Sheba but refers to her as The Queen of the South, saying that she would rise up in the Day of Judgement. This is what is known about The Queen of Sheba in Bible, but much more can be learned from this tradition particularlarily in African-Ethiopian Heritage, as we will see. Although not substantiated in the Bible, the Hebrew- Christian and African tradition relate that the entire book of Song of Songs, in the Bible to be a reflection and true content explaining the personal and intimate relationship between The Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. This link between The Queen of Sheba in the Song of Songs, is what makes her story so mysterious.</TH>

<TH>THE QUEEN OF SHEBA IN THE QUR'AN</TH>
<TH>A VIDEO ABOUT THE QUEEN OF SHEBA AND HER IMPORTANCE IN THE QUR'AN</TH>

<TH>When people think of The Queen of Sheba, they are often referring to The Queen of Sheba as she is known in Christian/ Hebrew tradition, in the Bible. Very few people realise that The Queen of Sheba is also a very important figure in Muslim tradition, as her story is also told in The Holy Qur'an. Therefore, for Muslims and people who read The Qur'an, when they hear other people refer to The Queen of Sheba, they automatically subscribe to her, the story as it has been revealed to them in The Qur'an. Whilst there are many similarities of The Queen of Sheba's story, in Bible and Qur'an and even her name can be clearly identified in The Qur'an, as she is called The Queen of Saba. In addition to the simularities in her name is also the fact that she travelled from her land to visit King Solomon, to hear his wisdom, carrying anbundance of precious goods, as well as her accepting Solomon's God and returning to her homeland in joy. However, outside of these fundemental similarities, there is much difference in the content and details of how this journey and visit took place. In fact, outside of the Muslim tradition few people are aware of The Queen of Sheba or Saba's visit to King Solomon, as it is relayed in The Qur'an. Ironically, the story in The Qur'an presents us with much more details about this visit and its purpose. To get a better understanding of this Queen it is therefore important to read both The Bible and Qur'an versions of the story, however like the Bible very little is given about who this Queen was, as like the Bible not even her name is given and she is simply known as The Queen of Saba. </TH>

<TH>To learn more about The Queen of Sheba, Saba, The Queen of the South and possibily the main female character in the Song of Songs, people turn to The Bible or The Qur'an. Whilst we know a lot about her specific visit to King Solomon from these sources, we learn absoluteley nothing about who she was, where she came from, not even her name is given. Luckily, due to the fame of this Queen, the facts that we do know from these sources is that: 1- Her Kingdom was well known and 2- was named The Land of Sheba or Saba, 3-it was situatied in the South and 4-that the kingdom she ruled was very wealthy. Upon these simple facts much more can be learned about this Queen once we can identify this ancient well known kingdom. Obviously, to do this we must identify the Kingdom of Saba. Two traditions exist today that are both accepted by modern science and within the archaological record. Which agree that this lengendary Queen ruled over 2 lands simultaeously, Ethiopia and part of Southern Arabia. Now, whilst very little about the Queen can be found in the Arabian tradtion outside of the Quranic reference and what is gathered from archeology, in Ethiopia, however this is not the case. In Ethiopia, although still linked to the Bible and Qur'an story, Ethiopian tradition provides us with much information and details about this Queen. It is only therefore within the tradition of the Ethiopians that we can actually get an insight into who the lengedary Queen of Sheba, known in Ethiopia as Queen Makedah, was. This tradition that brings together both the Bible and Qur'an narrative can be found complete in the lengedary Holy Book in Ethiopia called The Kebra Nagast, meaning The Glory of the Kings that details the history & heritage of the Queen of Sheba for over 6000 years, 3000 years of her ancestors, before her visit to King Solomon including the relationship hinted at in the Bible, especially in the Song of Songs and in the Qur'an that speaks of the union of Makedah and King Solomon that produced a son named Menelik I, who gave to the Ethiopians there line of Kings and Queens that proceeded from this union that has survived up until our modern day, ending only with Emperor Haile Selassie I, in 1974.</TH>

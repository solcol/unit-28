 <p>This is a picture of The Queen Of Sheba from Ethiopia, taken from a picture of her in a Bible illustrated for people of colour. I used this picture because it is one of the pictures on my baby photo frame that has many other Black Women who are great females that are famous in African- Caribbean- Ethiopian- World history & culture.</p>

<ol>
<li>Both Ethiopians and Southern Arabians acknowledged that The Queen of Sheba ruled in their countries. There is a lot of evidence to back this up as she was one of the most lengendary Queen's of all time.</li>
<br>
<li>The Queen of Sheba is mentioned in the Holy Bible, where she is an unamed queen of the Land of Sheba. The Bible states that she went to visit King Solomon and brought him many: Spices, Gold and other precious gifts. (1 Kings 10:1-10)</li>
<br>
<li>The Queen of Sheba and Mary the mother of Jesus are possibly two of the most cherished and celebrated women in history. They are taught about in Schools, Colleges and Universities across the world that carry on thier legacy and influence to help society and uplift women in particular.</li>
<br>
<li>The Queen of Sheba is also mentioned in the Qu'ran, where she is referred to as the Queen of Saba. (Chapter 27:17-44). She ruled over Saba which was in southwestern Arabia. Likewise in the Qur'an, the Queen of Saba was a very important Queen that had a successful relationship with Israel. In Arabian tradition, she is known as Bilqis and in Ethiopian tradition as Makedah.</li>

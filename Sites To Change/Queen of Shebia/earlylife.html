            <center><h2>EARLY LIFE OF THE QUEEN OF SHEBA</h2>

<p>As we have seen in the About Page, very little is known about the Early Life of The Queen of Sheba, other than what is found in tradition and inparticular African tradition. Therefore, in regards to what can be proven about her life, must be taken from what we know of her in The Bible and The Qur'an upon which the tradition is based. So here presented is the stories or verses of The Queen of Sheba, as it is relayed in The Holy Bible and The Holy Qur'an.

<h3>HOLY BIBLE PSLAM (KINGS 10:10)</h3>
<q>
1 Kings 10 King James Version (KJV)
10 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.
2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,
5 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.
9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

<h4>THE QUR'AN CHAPTER 34:15-20 (SABA)<h4>

In the Qur'an Chapter 34:
<q>
15. In Sheba's homeland there used to be a wonder: two gardens, on the right, and on the left. "Eat of your Lord's provision, and give thanks to Him." A good land, and a forgiving Lord.
16. But they turned away, so We unleashed against them the flood of the dam; and We substituted their two gardens with two gardens of bitter fruits, thorny shrubs, and meager harvest.
17. We thus penalized them for their ingratitude. Would We penalize any but the ungrateful?
18. Between them and the towns We had blessed, We placed prominent towns, and We made the travel between them easy. "Travel between them by night and day, in safety."
19. But they said, "Our Lord, lengthen the distances of our journeys." They wronged themselves; so We made them history, and We scattered them in every direction. In this are lessons for every steadfast and appreciative person.
20. Satan was correct in his assessment of them. They followed him, except for a group of believers.

<h4>THE QUR'AN CHAPTER 27:17-24 (THE ANT)<h4>
In the Qur'an chapter 27: (The Ant- an-Nami
17-24)
<q>
When Solomon called all his helpers together, the Hoopee bird was missing. When he returned he went to visit "The Queen of Sheba" and said that she has a magnificent throne but worshiped the sun. Here is the quote from the Qur'an: 
<q>
17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized his troops of sprites, and men, and birds-all held in strict order.
18. Until, when they came upon the Valley of Ants, an ant said, "O ants! Go into your nests, lest Solomon and his troops crush you without noticing."
19. He smiled and laughed at her words, and said, "My Lord, direct me to be thankful for the blessings you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do good works that please You. And admit me, by Your grace, into the company of Your virtuous servants."
20. Then he inspected the birds, and said, "Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees?
21. I will punish him most severely, or slay him, unless he gives me a valid excuse."
22. But he did not stay for long. He said, "I have learnt something you did not know. I have come to you from Sheba, with reliable information.
23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given of everything, and she has a magnificent throne.
24. I found her and her people worshiping the sun, instead of God. Satan made their conduct appear good to them, and diverted them from the path, so they are not guided.
</q>
<br>
<h4>THE QUR'AN CHAPTER 27:41-44 (THE ANT)<h4>
In the Qur'an chapter 27: (The Ant- an-Nami
41-44)
Solomon disguise her throne that he had taken from Ethiopia, when she saw it she accepted Solomon's God. Here is the quote from the Qur'an:
<q>
41. He said, "Disguise her throne for her, and we shall see whether she will be guided, or remains one of the misguided."
42. When she arrived, it was said, "Is your throne like this?" She said, "As if this is it." "We were given knowledge before her, and we were submissive."
43. But she was prevented by what she worshiped besides God; she belonged to a disbelieving people.
44. It was said to her, "Go inside the palace." And when she saw it, she thought it was a deep pond, and she bared her legs. He said, "It is a palace paved with glass." She said, "My Lord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have submitted with Solomon, to God, Lord of the Worlds."
</q>

<h4>THE FACE OF MAKEDAH</h4>
Even though we don't know what MAKEDAH looks like we find many pictures and paintings in Art over hundreds of years, where she is depiceted as been a very noble Queen often drawn as being of African Decesent, however she can be seen depiceted of all nationalities.
